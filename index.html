        <strong>Trent Wintermeier</strong> is a second-year Rhetoric PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. His research interests include: sound, noise, digital rhetorics, community, and digital humanities. 
        Currently, he's interested in the use of digital tools/media to think about sound and sonic conditions in community-engaged work. 
        Some of the questions he's researching include: 
        How do we and how should we participate in community-engaged work that is concerned with sound and digital technology?
What are the sonic conditions of communities, and how is sound emerging, shaping, impacting the operation of collective bodies?
What conceptions of digital rhetorics do we need to think about community-engaged work and sound studies as a field?
How may posthuman theory function to explain the relationship between community engagement, sound, and digital rhetorics as they intersect in our current moment? 
       <br><br>

        <strong>LISTENING ACROSS THE SHORTWAVE</strong> 
          </h1>
      <p>
        Listening Across the Shortwave is an interdisciplinary Build Day held by the Digital Writing and Research Lab during November 2023. 
        Participants worked together to construct DIY radio receivers, based on the open-source instructions from international feminist art group Shortwave Collective.
        Not only was this the DWRL's first build day of the year, but Listening Across the Shortwave was the first in-person workshop of this design in the United States.
        <br> <br>
        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/shortwave.jpeg?raw=true" width="345px" height="175px">
         <br> <br>
        Doing this work of building radios and listening to the shortwave involved recognizing how copper and found materials from around Austin function to receive signals. In fact, copper is
        the most abundant material in the Shortwave Collective's design. Not only does this include the coil, which serves as an inductor– but this also includes the 
        alligator clips that form the connections between each component. Both the antenna and ground are made of copper wire. Copper connects the radio to the Earth, capturing oscillating waves from the ionosphere, 
        and tunes and smooths them to a point where they become intelligible. Copper allows for us, as shortwave listeners and radio operators, 
        to connect with–to listen with–rare and found materials that make up radio receivers.

        <br><br>
        But what does it mean to use copper to turn wave oscillation into wave facilitation for the purpose of auditory perception? 
        Also, how do these sonic experiences engage differently with the world around us— like with the materials, the human and nonhuman, and the electromagnetic spectrum?
        Beginning to form some answer to these questions can, in a way, start with experimenting with found materials which go ignored or unnoticed in normative sonic registers. 
        Experimenting with found materials challenges our preconceptions of who or what ‘makes’ sound and also the function and role of certain materials.

<strong>ANNOTATING A DUALITY OF SPACES IN MURIEL RUKEYSER'S 'THE SPEED OF DARKNESS'</strong> 
          </h4>
      <p>
         Annotating a Duality of Spaces in Muriel Rukeyser's "The Speed of Darkness" is an AVAnnotate project created for the SpokenWeb Digital Anthology, edited by
      Dr. Zoe Bursztajn-Illingworth and Dr. Tanya Clement.
      <br><br>
      AVAnnotate is a software created by Clement and Brumfield Labs which allows users to create exhibits of annotated audiovisual material. The tool allows users to put together AV materials and accompanying 
        annotations in one place, allowing for easier access to artifacts. This happens through the use of IIIF manifests, one of which was created for the artifact borrowed from SpokenWeb's Sir George
         Williams Series.
        <br><br>
        “The last poem I’ll read this evening is a group. The group is called ‘The Speed of Darkness’,” the feminist and activist poet Muriel Rukeyser prefaces during the fortieth-minute of her 1969 reading at 
        Sir George Williams University (SGWU, now Concordia University), “they’re short poems, and I’ll just pause between poems. There should be numbers going up in back of me; one, two, three. I’ll just pause” 
        (Rukeyser “Muriel Rukeyser at SGWU, 1969,” added emphasis). In this moment, Rukeyser details how she will read and delineate the stanzas involving the title poem of her most recently published book at the time, 
        The Speed of Darkness. 
         <br><br>
        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/presentation.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="310px">
        <br><br>
        In her in-person reading, she will “just pause” between each part of the “group”—or, later in 1972, what she calls a “series” (Mitts 2015)—to separate the stanzas in “The Speed of Darkness.” 
        However, in SpokenWeb’s audio recording of this reading, her visual aid is obscured, which complicates the spaces between each stanza in the group. What was “brought into relation with the other through juxtaposition” 
        (Mitts 2015) in text now coalesces to give entirely new meaning to the full poem. And, when digitally annotated, Rukeyser’s “The Speed of Darkness” more clearly exhibits how these spaces involve a transformative meaning-making practice.
 <br><br>
        This project has been presented at Learn@DLF 2023; ADHO's DH2023; and SpokenWeb 2023.

        <strong>COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND DATA CENTER NOISE</strong> 
          </h2>
      <p>
        Community Resilience and Data Center Noise is an ongoing project that considers how residental communities are
        impacted by the noise and rhetoric emerging from data center cooling practices. Beginning in summer 2023, I trace my visit to MetCenter
        --a business park in Austin, TX, which has four data center facilities--through CyrusOne's 2022 Sustainability Report. 
        These data center facilities make noise which sounds like a low whirring of fan blades mixed with metallic vibrations bouncing around 
        inside of big machines and tubes connecting the interior and exterior of the facility. 
        <br><br>
        The Sustainability Report uses “resilience” to frame an appealing community response 
        operates within but also reveals the systems of power that are involved in data center and community relationships. 
        To be resilient to data center noise is to be complicit within the affective networks that emerge within and due to the 
        noise of data center cooling. 
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/datacenter.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="200px">

        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/5copy.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="300px">
         <br><br>
        The CDC states that constant exposure to noise, regardless of decibel or frequency, may cause “stress, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, 
        heart disease, and many other health problems.” Quite literally, the noise of data centers is slowly killing entire communities, and this health threat is only 
        expedited by framing their sonic experience as one that requires strength and adaptability. Resilience, 
        then, isn’t a community’s ability to withstand noise—it’s a community’s willingness to ignore the sonic, 
        sensory, and bodily signs resulting from data center cooling practices.

<strong>STEPPING STONES</strong> 
  </h1>
         <p>
        Stepping Stones is a collaborative project developed by Sam Turner and myself which celebrates ways of relating within and outside of writing spaces. In June 2020, 
        Andrea Riley-Mukavetz challenged rhetoric and writing scholars to write about “the practices that scare us, challenge us, [and] leave us with new answers or unarticulated meaning” 
        (546). These practices–which scholars including Anderson, Kynard, Mao, Royster, and countless others also orient us towards–help us reimagine a future for the discipline, and to 
        develop constellated relationships with each other and the world. 
              <br><br>
        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/3.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="300px">
        <br><Br>
        These relationships are accountable to and reverent of all of our different ways of knowing and being, and echo 
        scholars across rhetorical studies who theorize, seek, and enact justice, abundance, and relationality through their work. Such a goal is in communication with cultural rhetorics 
        as a hopeful intervention into our own personal and scholarly writing practices.
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/trent%20and%20sam.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="200px">
        <br><Br>
        The project has grown to include, in total, 10 coauthors. Each author is part of a process of (re)orienting research towards liberatory action with an attention to longing and 
        disruption, and especially the often-unheard voices of multiply marginalized graduate students. Co-authors invited one another to reflect on the embodied and affective dimensions 
        of what it means to be a graduate student right now, and in what ways we relate to ourselves, one another, and our departmental and institutional contexts more broadly. The project 
        is a step toward ethical and intentional engagement with the scholars and exigencies that we’re in conversation with, and we recognize that we are not alone in our yearnings to critically 
        reinvigorate our ways of knowing and being. 
        <br><br>
        This project is set to be presented at CCCC 2024.

<strong>COMMUNICATING U.S. LATINE ACTIVISM</strong> 
      </h3>
      <p>
      Communicating U.S. Latine Activism is an exhibit curated during LLILAS Benson's Digital Scholarship Internship that was published by Texas ScholarWorks.
         The exhibit explores the communication practices of US Latine activists throughout various movements from the 1960s to the early 2000s. By focusing on specific 
        methods and strategies in media communications—sound bites, flagging, and hooking—the project argues that these practices offer new meaning to civil, labor, and 
        LGBTQ+ movements. US Latine activists utilize these media methods symbolically in a way that can be traced and connected throughout multiple civic efforts and media. 
        This includes sound bites in recorded interviews covering unionization and police brutality; flagging in newspaper clippings concerning the rights of Texas farm workers; 
        and hooking in pins, stickers, pamphlets, zines, and many other materials.
        <br><Br>

        <br><Br>
        The project’s goal is to offer new meaning to US Latine movements. How movements become connected to audiences through communication practices is significant to this goal. 
        Developing this claim requires navigating through nearly 50 years of communications artifacts, hours of recorded broadcasting, and contextual information from various sources. 
        Central to this exhibit is GLAAD’s “MediaEssentials Training Manual,” which is located in LLILAS Benson’s “The National Latina/o Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered Organization” collection. 
        “MediaEssentials” outlines how Latine activists can effectively communicate the goals of their respective movements through certain media strategies, which offers valuable insight into US Latine 
        activists’ techniques.

        Included in the 30-page exhibit is a lesson plan for instructors looking to use audio materials in their classrooms with the goal of helping students enter conversations in the 
        digital humanities, especially as they involve sonic artifacts coming out of activist movements.

<strong>SONIC AFTERLIFES</strong> 
        </H1>
      <p>
      Sonic Afterlifes is a ongoing project which brings together homemade radio telescope designs, GNU Radio, and 
        MIDI note mapping via Python to question how we concieve of and practice data collection. 
       In his recent book, Listening in the Afterlife of Data, David Cecchetto claims that “we are living in a time when data persists as an impactful element in the absence of any material existence” (9). 
       So too in the Digital Humanities (DH) do the persuasive elements of data impact our scholarship, tools, and goals—even when we acknowledge how data doesn’t tell the full story or, sometimes, 
       any story at all. This has been solidified in the field by scholars such as Jennifer Guiliano and Carolyn Heitman, who detail the complexities of data collection and ways of knowing 
       data that function in Indigenous contexts (“Difficult Heritage and the Complexities of Indigenous Data”). And Miriam Posner has further situated the influence of data in DH settings 
       by foregrounding the relationship between data and humanistic inquiry (“Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction”). 
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/telescope.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="375px">
      <br><br>
       I contribute to these same data-focused inquiries through a focus on the process and practice of building a radio telescope to sonify data collected on the hydrogen line. 
       Building homemade radio telescopes to collect data with GNU Radio and sonifying it with Python intervenes in traditional valuations and applications of data when we represent 
       hydrogen line data differently (via sound). Data sonification, in this way, offers a revised way of knowing the technologies we concieve, build, and employ-- and also how we think about
        actions done in the name of collected data. This project continues to think with Cecchetto by relating his conception of data and DH methods to see what we hear when we complicate
        unquestioned processes of collection across a variety of domains. 
       <br><br>
       This project is set to be presented at SpokenWeb 2024, and it has been submitted to ADHO's DH24.

    <strong>REVIEW OF RUHA BENJAMIN'S BOOK, VIRAL JUSTICE</strong> 
        </H4>
        <p>
        Review of Ruha Benjamin's book, Viral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want is written as part of the "Ecologies of Solidarity: Organizing, Labor, and Activism" section of E3W's 23rd Volume, From the 
        Ground Up: Embodiment, Resistance, and Sovereign Voices." 
         <br><br>
         <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/4copy.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="300px">
         <br><BR>
        Benjamin  cultivates attunement to a new vision of the world where individual and collective action promotes unrelenting, perpetual justice. In her invitation to “get to the root cause of what’s ailing us” 
        and “accept our interconnectedness,” Benjamin positions the virality of justice as a solution to the constant hate, suffering, and harm that encircles everyday life in the United States.
        “We have to unshackle our collective imagination,” Benjamin suggests in Chapter Seven, “La Casa Azul,” to engage a world where viral justice is not only a priority but an imperative. Even more so, 
        this world which embodies individual and collective significance must become irresistible.In this way, Benjamin’s book offers ample incentive, evidence, and instruction for any reader to begin forging 
        a world where love, care, and community are affirmed. 
               <br><br>
         <img src="https://github.com/trentwintermeier/tjwintermeier/blob/main/assets/e3w.jpg?raw=true" width="345px" height="500px">
         <br><br>
        Viral justice, then, is a way to approach being and thinking in a world where collective life is the essence of individual success. This requires trust, 
        vulnerability, truthfulness, and coalition—to name only a few values of this hopeful dream—for the affirmation of life to experience such viral intensity that it becomes ineluctable. Viral Justice: How We Grow the 
        World We Want begins this process, and now, according to Ruha Benjamin, it is our responsibility to “finally grow the fuck up” and create opportunities for justice in our current moment.
