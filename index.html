        <strong>Listening Across the Shortwave</strong> was interdisciplinary Build Day held by the Digital Writing and Research Lab during November 2023. 
        Participants worked together to construct DIY radio receivers, based on the open-source instructions from international feminist art group Shortwave Collective.
        Not only was this the DWRL's first build day of the year, but Listening Across the Shortwave was the first in-person workshop of this design in the United States.

        Doing this work of building radios and listening to the shortwave involved recognizing how copper and found materials from around Austin function to receive signals. In fact, copper is
        the most abundant material in the Shortwave Collective's design. Not only does this include the coil, which serves as an inductor– but this also includes the 
        alligator clips that form the connections between each component. Both the antenna and ground are made of copper wire. Copper connects the radio to the Earth, capturing oscillating waves from the ionosphere, 
        and tunes and smooths them to a point where they become intelligible. Copper allows for us, as shortwave listeners and radio operators, 
        to connect with–to listen with–rare and found materials that make up radio receivers.

        <br><br>
        But what does it mean to use copper to turn wave oscillation into wave facilitation for the purpose of auditory perception? 
        Also, how do these sonic experiences engage differently with the world around us— like with the materials, the human and nonhuman, and the electromagnetic spectrum?
        Beginning to form some answer to these questions can, in a way, start with experimenting with found materials which go ignored or unnoticed in normative sonic registers. 
        Experimenting with found materials challenges our preconceptions of who or what ‘makes’ sound and also the function and role of certain materials.

<strong>Annotating a Duality of Spaces in Muriel Rukeyser's "The Speed of Darkness"</strong> is an AVAnnotate project created for the SpokenWeb Digital Anthology, edited by
      Dr. Zoe Bursztajn-Illingworth and Dr. Tanya Clement.
      <br><br>
      AVAnnotate is a software created by Clement and Brumfield Labs which allows users to create exhibits of annotated audiovisual material. The tool allows users to put together AV materials and accompanying 
        and annotations in one place, allowing for easier access to artifacts. This happens through the use of IIIF manifests, one of which was created for the artifact borrowed from SpokenWeb's Sir George
         Williams Series.
        <br><br>
        “The last poem I’ll read this evening is a group. The group is called ‘The Speed of Darkness’,” the feminist and activist poet Muriel Rukeyser prefaces during the fortieth-minute of her 1969 reading at 
        Sir George Williams University (SGWU, now Concordia University), “they’re short poems, and I’ll just pause between poems. There should be numbers going up in back of me; one, two, three. I’ll just pause” 
        (Rukeyser “Muriel Rukeyser at SGWU, 1969,” added emphasis). In this moment, Rukeyser details how she will read and delineate the stanzas involving the title poem of her most recently published book at the time, 
        The Speed of Darkness. In her in-person reading, she will “just pause” between each part of the “group”—or, later in 1972, what she calls a “series” (Mitts 2015)—to separate the stanzas in “The Speed of Darkness.” 
        However, in SpokenWeb’s audio recording of this reading, her visual aid is obscured, which complicates the spaces between each stanza in the group. What was “brought into relation with the other through juxtaposition” 
        (Mitts 2015) in text now coalesces to give entirely new meaning to the full poem. And, when digitally annotated, Rukeyser’s “The Speed of Darkness” more clearly exhibits how these spaces involve a transformative meaning-making practice.
